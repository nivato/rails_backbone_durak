rails_backbone_durak
====================

More advanced version of Rails+Backbone single page application<br>
Note: While developing this app I've realized what an ugly database calls consuming monster it is going to be.<br>
Anyway, I'm going to finish it as it is, because my goal is nothing but an attempt to learn to develop single-page app with Rails and Backbone.js<br>
<br>
[27 Feb 2013] Creted db-monster-stable brunch to start refactoring backend for more sufficient database use.
